Employee Data Research Project

In the employee data research project, I dove into the employment history of a company during the 1980s and 1990s using six CSV files containing employee data.

Project Highlights:

Data Modeling: Design database tables for CSV data.
Data Engineering: Import CSV data into a SQL database.
Data Analysis: Write SQL queries to answer key questions.

Project Structure:

ER Diagram: Find an ERD image and text file in the ER Diagram folder.
EmployeeSQL_tables.sql: Create tables with designed schemata from this script.
EmployeeSQL_queries.sql: Run queries to gain insights from the data.
Data: Historical employee data resides in the Data folder.
